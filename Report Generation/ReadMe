Assumption to run this scripts:
Firstly all the command line arguments should be passed with out any ambiguity.
Secondly we assume data collected using loadTesting.sh is accessible from the current directory where the reportGeneration.sh is runned.
Script reportGeneration.sh takes three command line arguments 'arg1', 'arg2' and 'arg3' as shown below.

$reportGeneration.sh arg1 arg2 arg3

Here first argument "arg1" is the file containing all urls for which for we need to run 'ab' tool. Each line of 'arg1' contains a url. For example look at the 'urls' file.

And second argument "arg2" is the file containing values for parameter 'n' and 'c' where
'n' is the no of requests and 'c' is the level of concurrecy. Each line of such an file indicates values for 'n' and 'c'. For example look at the first line of 'config' file contains "100 20" where '100' is the no of requests and '20' is the concurrency level.

And third argument "arg3" is the file containing all fields which need to be extracted from data generated using script loadTesting.sh. For example look at the 'fields'file that contains some significant fields.
