Load Testing consist of three modules:
a)Data Collection 
b)Report Generation
c)Analysis

Data Collection Module: 
As part of this module we collect data using 'Apache Benchmark' tool for different hyperlinks on the server. 
We run following script from command line "$loadTesting.sh urls config" to collect the data.
Here loadTesting.sh is the script to collect data from for each hyperlink in 'urls' file and it collects data based on the parameter
specified in 'config' file. This script is well commented and described in 'ReadMe' associated with it.
Note: Data Collected using this module is feeded as input to Report Generation Module.

Report Generation Module:
Data collected during Data collection Module is aggregated into a csv file for attributes specified in 'fields' file
using following script "$reportGeneration.sh urls config fields". Here reportGeneration.sh is the script to aggregate data
from for each hyperlink in 'urls' file and the parameter specified in 'config' file. Here 'fields' file contains all the
that we need to do analysis. This script is well commented and described in 'ReadMe' associated with it.
Note that csv files generated using this module is used for doing analysis.


Analysis:
CSV files generated by Report Generation Module are used to perform analysis and show the findings like faults with apache server
configuration, network latency issues etc.
